Our task in this project is twofold:
* Firstly, a simulation is to be created in Unreal Engine, which will contain a drone with all flying capabilities, as well as be able to spawn random people in random places on the map, as well as change the weather to be able to change visibility for drone, as well as test flying capabilities in challenging weather such as snow, wind, rain, storm etc. This simulation must be controllable through python, allowing maximal control in a user friendly way
* Secondly, an agent must be trained through reinforcement learning techniques to locate the spawned people or objects on the map. The agent (drone) will have full flight capabilities with no knowledge of the positioning of the people on the map.
